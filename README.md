## Usage

After installing the module, when viewing a system configuration field, an alert icon and message will be shown below the field value if it has been overridden at a more specific scope.

The icon is only shown when the value is overridden at a more specific scope than the current one â€“ that is, if viewing at the default scope, overrides at the website or store view level are shown, but if viewing at the website level, only overrides below the currently selected website are shown.

Along with the alert message, a detailed list of the exact scope(s) that override the value, with links directly to the store config for the current section at those scopes. Clicking an override hint row arrow will expand the row to also show the field's value at that scope.

## Compatibility and Technical Notes

As of version 3.0.0 of this module has been tested against Magento 2.1.x. It's likely compatible with 2.0.x as well, but this is untested.

> NOTE: For known compatibility with 2.0.x, check out version [2.1.0][2.1.0] of the module.

## Known Issues

### MAGETWO-62648

When used on Magento 2.1.3, the module can produce a false positive when viewing a website scope. If a given config value has been overridden at this website scope, any children store views which have "Use Website" set for the value will incorrectly show as being overridden. 

This is a known [core bug][MAGETWO-62648].

### Non-standard Fieldset Renderers

Store config groups which use non-standard fieldset renderers are currently ignored. Of the native store config fields, the following exhibit this trait.

* Advanced -> Advanced -> Disable Modules Output
* Sales -> Payment Methods
